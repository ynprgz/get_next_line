# get_next_line

## Overview

The **get_next_line** project is a fundamental C programming exercise that aims to deepen the understanding of file handling and memory management in the C language. The goal is to create a function `get_next_line()` which reads a line from a file descriptor, including handling edge cases, large files, and different buffers efficiently. This project is commonly assigned in coding schools like 42 to practice buffer-based reading and linked list management.

### Function Prototype

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```
